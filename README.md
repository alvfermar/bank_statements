# Text analytics with bank statements data

The aim of this project is to provide an example of bank statement categorization using data resampled from a real fintech. You will find everything to reproduce the analysis locally:

* CSV data
* EDA as pandas-profiling reports HTML files
* requirements.txt file
* Detailed jupyter notebook

Please refer to [the notebook](https://github.com/alvfermar/bank_statements/blob/master/bank_statements.ipynb) for a detailed explanation of the analysis.
